# My web-develper journal

This file is a Bio/Portfolio to keep track of my professional developer &amp; open source highlights.

**Why?:** Because I have a memory of a Squirrel :squirrel: !
What I don't write down I forget and then I loose track of stuff
I've already done or Pull Requested.

It already happened to me several time that I've done the same PR twice
( and GitHub activity log is not much help either)

...so, here is my stupid narcissistic list of:
